# Notes

- I saw that when the route to the game is called multiple times, the ball slows down.

## Things to check

    Game Loop Optimization: You have a recursive call to requestAnimationFrame within the gameLoop method, but you are also using async/await pattern with .then. Using both might cause the game loop to become heavy and decrease performance. Stick to one pattern for game loop. Preferably, use requestAnimationFrame without async/await.

    Remove Document Event Listeners: In ngOnDestroy, you're only removing event listeners. But, I see that you add them in startGame method, which is called in ngOnInit. Make sure that you're not calling startGame more than once, because it would add multiple instances of the same listeners.

    Key Handling: Your handleKeyDown function is commented out, which means you're not adding any keys to the keysPressed set. This might make the paddles non-responsive.

    Canvas Context: It is better to store the canvas context (ctx) as a member variable instead of getting it every time you want to render something.

    Error Handling: You are returning and logging errors in some functions like renderBackground. Instead, you might want to handle these more gracefully or even throw custom errors for handling at a higher level.

    Async Inside Loop: Inside the movePaddles method, you're using an asynchronous call with a setTimeout inside a loop. This is not recommended as it can be a performance issue. Consider revising this logic.

    Use Constants for Magic Numbers: You have numbers like 20, 80, etc. in your code. It is a good practice to store these values in named constants, to give them meaning and make the code more readable.

    Type Safety: Ensure proper type checking. For example, in initGame, you're using a conditional if statement if (!this.paddleStart || !this.paddleEnd), after creating instances. TypeScript can assure that these are non-null, so this check may not be necessary.

    Ball Slowing Down Issue: I don't see any logic that would change the speed of the ball. However, check that the ball speed is constant and not being modified accidentally. Also, if you are calculating movement based on elapsed time, make sure that the calculation is correct.

    Vector Values: Make sure that the values of the vectors that you are using for movement are normalized. If not, this can lead to unexpected speeds.

## More Ideas

    Global State: Check if there is any global state that is not being reinitialized properly when the route is called multiple times. This can cause unexpected behavior like the slowing down of the ball.

    Event Listeners: Check if multiple instances of the event listeners are being attached when the route is called multiple times. This can cause the same code to be executed multiple times and slow down the application.

    Accumulation of Objects: See if new objects (e.g., Ball instances) are being created without properly cleaning up the old ones. This can cause memory usage to keep increasing, and eventually, it can slow down the application.

    Animations and Game Loop: It seems like a game; therefore, it should have an animation/game loop. Check how the game loop is implemented and how it’s handling the timing. It's possible that the game loop is not being reset properly when the route is called multiple times.

    Browser or Application Resource Limits: It's possible that there's a resource issue. Check the browser's task manager to see if CPU or memory usage is unusually high. This might indicate a performance problem in your code.

    Check for any Network Calls: Check if your application is making any network calls. Maybe network latency or issues could be a factor.

    Timing Variables: Check if there are any timing variables that are not being reset when the route is called again.

    Browser Rendering Performance: Ensure that the browser’s rendering performance is not affecting the speed of the ball. This can be checked through the browser's developer tools.

    Logging: I see that there are several console.log and console.error statements. Too much logging can sometimes slow down an application, especially if logging is happening in the render loop. You might want to comment these out during debugging to see if it makes a difference.
